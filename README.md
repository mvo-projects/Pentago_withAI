# Pentago_withAI

### Installation

My Pentago requires OpenGL/GLUT librairies.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
```

Clone the project, then :
```sh
$ make
```

### The Goal
Align 5 pawns faster than your opponent !
The mind twisting part of Pentago is that each player will also twist one of the four game blocks 90 degrees (one “notch”), clockwise or counter clockwise, as part of each turn. A 180 degree (double “notch”) twist is not allowed. The twist is the key to create winning positions in Pentago.

### AI
Rules + Monte Carlo
